I am an archaeologist working mainly on 1st millennium CE Italy. I am particularly interested in quantitative approaches and Bayesian modelling of environmental archaeological data.

As part of my doctoral project, I have just released an open access [dataset](https://github.com/robertoragno/phd/tree/main/Quarto%20files/Database%20export) which includes archaeobotanical macroremains and zooarchaeological NISP data from mainland Italy. Currently, I am one of the coordinators of the *Northern Apulia Coastal Survey*, which aims to investigate the historical settlement dynamics of the wetland and coastal areas of northern Apulia, Italy. In particular, I focus on fieldwork methodology and modelling of survey data.


I am **open for postdoctoral positions** in quantitative archaeology from late 2025!
