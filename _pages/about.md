I am an archaeologist specialising in the 1st millennium CE Italian countryside, with a particular focus on quantitative approaches and Bayesian modelling of environmental archaeological data.

As part of my doctoral project, I have just released an open access dataset which includes [archaeobotanical macroremains](https://doi.org/10.5334/joad.147) and [zooarchaeological NISP data](https://github.com/robertoragno/phd/tree/main/Quarto%20files/Database%20export) from mainland Italy. I also co-coordinate the *Northern Apulia Coastal Survey*, a long-term project investigating settlement dynamics in the wetland and coastal landscapes of northern Apulia, where I focus on fieldwork methodology and the modelling of survey data.

I am currently working on the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions project [BTChron](https://doi.org/10.3030/101201843) which aims to better integrate chronological uncertainty into typo-chronologically dated archaeological datasets and to develop stronger tools for large-scale temporal analysis, ultimately hoping to improve our understanding of agricultural change during the Roman period!
