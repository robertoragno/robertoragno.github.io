I am an archaeologist working mainly on 1st millennium CE Italy. I am particularly interested in quantitative approaches and Bayesian modelling of environmental archaeological data.

As part of my doctoral project, I have just released an open access [database](https://github.com/robertoragno/phd/tree/main/Quarto%20files/Database%20export) which includes archaeobotanical macroremains and zooarchaeological NISP data from mainland Italy. The database will soon be accompanied by a queryable interface for easier navigation and access.

I am currently **open for postdoc positions** in quantitative archaeology!
